= Vision =

With votering you can create your own vote rings and easily incoporate them into
any webpage.

== Technical ==

Use django social as much as possible. Allow auth via other apps.

=== Entities ===

* User
 * Use random username and never show it because it might be too short and unrelated
 to the user auth string, for example an url in openid etc.
 * add dynamic fields via json info field
 * Login via linked in, password, google, facebook..

=== Models ===

* User (extends django.contrib.auth.models)
 * info (JSONField, for dynamic extensions)

* Team
 * name (string)
 * description (text)
 * members (relation with User)
 * admins (relation with User)
 * permissions (enum like flags)

* VoteRing
 * admins (list of users, relation with User)
 * admin_team (relation with Team)
 
== Views ==
* Main page
  * Shows a list of public views
